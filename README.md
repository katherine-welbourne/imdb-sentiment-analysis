## **Overview**
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment analysis. Using the IMDB dataset, we classify movie reviews as either **positive** or **negative**.

Key features:
- Preprocessing and tokenization using Hugging Face's `transformers`.
- Fine-tuning with Hugging Face's `Trainer` API.
- Real-world predictions on unseen text data.
- Interactive demo via Gradio/Streamlit.

---

## **Dataset**
The dataset used is the [IMDB dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb), which contains:
- **50,000 movie reviews**: 25,000 for training and 25,000 for testing.
- Labels: `positive` and `negative`.

---

## **Model**
The model is based on `distilbert-base-uncased`, a smaller, faster version of BERT:
- **Base Model**: [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased)
- **Fine-Tuned For**: Sentiment classification
- **Framework**: Hugging Face Transformers

---

## **Installation**
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/katherine-welbourne/imdb-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd imdb-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers datasets torch gradio
   ```

---

## **Training**
1. Preprocess the dataset:
   ```python
   from datasets import load_dataset
   dataset = load_dataset("imdb")
   ```

2. Fine-tune the model:
   ```python
   from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
   # Define training arguments and train the model
   ```

3. Save the fine-tuned model:
   ```python
   model.save_pretrained("./sentiment_model")
   tokenizer.save_pretrained("./sentiment_model")
   ```

---

## **Evaluation**
Evaluate the model's performance on the test set:
```python
trainer.evaluate()
```

Metrics:
- **Accuracy**: 94%
- **F1-Score**: 93%

---

## **Results**
Example predictions:
| Input Text                                | Prediction |
|-------------------------------------------|------------|
| "This movie was amazing! I loved it."     | Positive   |
| "The plot was boring and uninspired."     | Negative   |

---

## **Demo**
Try the model using the interactive web app:
- **Demo Link**: [Gradio/Streamlit App](#) *(Add link once hosted)*
- Run locally:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
